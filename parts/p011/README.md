## package org.rapidpm.event.mutationtesting.p011.extended
### Service
Start testing the Implementation you can find in the class Service.
* try to find out, what this implementation is doing
* create the best test coverage for this you can
* use this to start refactoring this implementation
    The refactoring should be done in a second class, 
    because you will need the orig implementation as reference.
    
* use all techniques you know that is provided from junit5
